Introduction For this Car Racing Game, we would like to accomplish a video game imitating the existing game showed with a projective view. The theme of our game is to compete with the other 1 opponent that are controlled by computer in a racing tournament, the player’s goal is to complete all laps as soon as possible while trying to avoid bumping to other cars or road object, the final score will be posted according to the finishing position, numbers of bumps and the time.

Project description: This game is based on current video game market uprise in India as more and more people are turning, their head to video games. All the assets used in this project are open source and downloaded from the internet. The game consists of 2 level for maps and 3 cars and is based on basic flash video games, but can be added to iOS, android as well as pc using the conversion from unity3d. The main objective is to defeat other computer-generated cars by winning the race or complete all laps 1st.

Abstract: We have successfully created a video game which can be played on any pc. As it is developed by using unity engine it is quite easy to run-on low-end pcs. It consists of latest game development software of unity. The game has been made by single developer me as per 3d standard of video games. The knowledge of game programming subject was used while making this game. Coding was done using visual studio. Unity3d was used to make the game. Assets were downloaded from the internet. The game was tested by various people.

Future Scope: • Adding a function to random button on main menu to choose random car, random mode and random track automatically. • Adding 2nd track to the game for change of environment with night mode. • Adding cash and reward system to the game.

Most of the videos launched in the past are aren’t made using latest game engine. The game has been updated after the software update. Limitation of the video game: • As a single developer the game don’t have many levels. • To keep it bug free the bug has to be solved by the game developer or any experience developer only • It’s an offline game. • If anyone encounters a bug, they have to contact developer personally. To reduce the make time only one level and 2 cars are added to the final version.

Advantages of our game:
